First of all, I am so happy to see this work seemed useful to you. Also **THANK YOU** for your help.
There are many ways you can help this project and all Iranian and Persian speakers all around the word:

# Find A Bug
The simplest thing that you can do is if you see any bug, bad code and etc, [open an issue](https://github.com/alihoseiny/ngx-persian/issues) and tell us there is a problem.
This way you can help us find problems.

But please before creating new issue, search for simmilar issues and avoid opening duplicated issues.

# Requesting New Features
Another helpful thing you can do is requesting a useful feature that is not in the library yet. For this, you can [open an issue](https://github.com/alihoseiny/ngx-persian/issues) and request a feature for implementing.

# Adding New Features
And most helpful thing is adding new features in the library.

## How You can Help All Iranian Angular Developers?
You are wondering how you can contribute in this project? Here is a list of what you can do:
1. You did anything useful and special for Iranian apps? So you can add that in this library and save other developers time.
2. You think number of tests for some part of this library is not enough? So you can write more tests.
3. Documents are not enough? You can help us by adding more documents.
4. Current code could be better? You can make this cleaner or faster.

You should follow these steps for contributing in this project:
## 1. Getting the Repository
For contributing, first fork the repository. Then create your branch and start coding.
## 2. Follow the Flow
We are using `git flow` in this project for keeping things clean and maintainable. If you don't now how to use git flow, you can find it [here](http://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/) in less than a minute.
## 3. Add Tests
We are following TDD guides for developing this library, So you **SHOULD** add tests first and then add your code.
## 4. Write the Dock
All codes should have complete in-code document following JSDoc syntax. Plus you should re-generate the code document using [compodoc](https://compodoc.app).
For generating documents, you should run following command in the _project_ directory:
`npm run generate-docs`

Also you should add some documents about how to using a feature in the `README.md` file.

## 5. Create A Pull Request
Now you are done and want to add your code. So come here and create a new pull request. Please make pull request message complete and useful. Also you should keep all commit messages in your branch meaningful and useful.
